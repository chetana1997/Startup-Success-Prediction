# Startup-Sucess-Prediction

Summary:

We have built the “Startup Success Predictions” project with Machine Learning techniques. The main objective of our project is to predict the success of the startup based on the data we have taken and trained from Kaggle which was initially taken from Crunchbase. Making predictions about a company's performance and understanding the factors that influence it are therefore crucial tasks. Investors have an advantage over other investors because they can better identify businesses with the potential for quick expansion by anticipating the success of startups.
We offer a method for predicting a startup's performance based on a number of crucial factors, including the number of funding rounds, milestones, relationships, and other factors affecting the company's success or failure at each milestone. Numerous data mining validations and optimizations were done to the preprocessed data, along with various data mining categorization techniques. For the time being, we delivered our analyses and made predictions using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Neural Networking. To present our insights, we have also made use of Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks. We assessed the accuracy of our models using assessment criteria like ROC curve, precision, and recall. We show how a startup could use our models to identify the factors to which it should pay closer attention in order to succeed. Additionally, we have included a more complicated model that uses a new level of neural networking to obtain the predictions.
